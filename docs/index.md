# SC2RO

The Smart Citizen Cyber Resilience Ontology (SC2RO) maps the cyber resilience landscape for individuals. It identifies cyber resources, vulnerabilities, threats, responses and harms associated with and specific to individual citizen's cyber functionings.

Cyber resilience is the ability to maintain positive functioning and adaptation in the context of adverse cyber incidents, which can be technical, socio-technical, natural, and manmade.

Cyber resilience has largely been framed from the perspectives of nation-states, governments, and the private sector. This framing tends to neglect the cyber resilience role of civil society stakeholders. Further, cybersecurity frameworks, as well as resilience management frameworks have focused on building the security and resilience of critical infrastructures, information systems, critical sectors, and for-profit organizations. Such a focus makes it difficult to operationalize cyber resilience into relevant instruments and modalities for engagement and participation of civil society stakeholders as active cyber resilience agents.

This ontology is part of a project that aims to **enhance the resilience of citizens in smart digital futures**.
